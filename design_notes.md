# Development Notes

We want to be able to do a few things:

- Upload images to Smugmug
- Get back snippets for different sizes and store them next to a thumb of the image for later reference (e.g. copy to clipboard)
- include alt text, etc. at upload
  - check metadata at upload and before posting to Smugmug
  - option to edit the metadata at upload and before posting
- Provide a way to quickly unfuck the existing featured images and such on my blogs
- Get micro.blog out of my image processing pipeline

### Maybe someday? 

- Do something with Cloudflare with all of this? 


### UI 

- Main page: Upload an image. 
  - select from disk
  - review/add/change metadata
  - get back relevant info from Smugmug and store it with a reference to the thumb

- Gallery page
  - past uploads with "copy to clipboard" snippets for common use cases

- Atom feed
  - something I can push somewhere
